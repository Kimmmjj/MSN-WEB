  <p>When Luis Suarez joined FC Barcelona in the summer of 2014, the club's critics said his arrival would disrupt the team's established frontline, comprising of fellow global superstars Lionel Messi and Neymar Jr. The three could never play together, they said. How wrong they were. 'MSN', as they became known, gelled instantly. They scored 122 goals between them in their first season together. They won a historic treble. And though the following season wouldn't bring as many trophies, Messi, Suarez and Neymar Jr still managed to add another 131 goals. By the time this formidable trio was broken up with the transfer of Neymar Jr to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017, the frontline that would never be able to play together had combined to score a grand total of 364 in 450. <br>What a waste of time, eh?</p>
